# 📸 Profile Appearance Tester

A professional-grade web utility designed to help users visualize how their profile pictures (DPs) will look across different social media platforms before they upload. 

**Live Demo:** [https://voidaasif.github.io/profile-appearance-tester/](https://voidaasif.github.io/profile-appearance-tester/)

## 🚀 Why Use This?
Every social media platform uses a different background color and circular crop. A photo that looks great on **Instagram Dark Mode** might lose its impact on **Gmail Light Mode**. This tool allows you to:
- **Test Environments:** Switch between Instagram, WhatsApp, Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X.
- **Toggle Themes:** Instantly swap between Dark and Light UI modes.
- **Precision Fitting:** Use sliders to adjust Zoom, Rotation, and X/Y positioning for the perfect crop.

## ✨ Features
- **Zero Server Uploads:** Your photos stay private. Processing is done entirely in your browser using the FileReader API.
- **Interactive UI:** Real-time CSS transformation engine for smooth adjustments.
- **Platform Specifics:** Background colors are matched to the official hex codes of each platform.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Custom Properties & Flexbox)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (No external libraries required)
